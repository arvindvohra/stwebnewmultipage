                        <p>Startblocks is a cloud-based international student recruitment platform for universities. The platform uses its fast-growing network of certified student advisors, called ‘Trusted Advisors (TAs)’, to allow global universities to expand their reach, and receive high-quality applications from students across diverse regions at significantly lower costs.</p>

                        <p>The platform uses automated document verification and integrity checks to assure fast, accurate and transparent application processing, with up to 80% reduction in application turn-around time. It can simultaneously process large volumes of student applications from different countries by taking advantage of its proprietary technology, built on “block-based cube analysis” of each interaction in counselling.</p>

                        <p>Through its network of Trusted Advisors, StartBlocks also helps and guides students seeking foreign education to choose the right course in the right international university. Trained by Startblocks, the Trusted Advisors provide a consistent and trusted counselling experience to applicants for better outcomes.</p>

                        <p>The parent company of Startblocks, Australia Software & Technology Solutions, was founded in 2020 with a mission to democratise foreign education for all. Startblocks is backed by the Australian Technical and Management College (ATMC), a global education provider with more than 25,000 international students and operations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and India.</p>
